**Pet Store Application**  

**Project Description**  
The Pet Store application is a console-based program that allows users to browse, buy, and manage pets. Users can view different types of pets, each with unique attributes and behaviors, and can add them to their shopping cart for purchase. The application implements key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.

**Features**  
Browse Pets: Users can view details of available pets (Dogs, Cats, Birds) and choose to add them to their shopping cart.  
Manage Owned Pets: Users can view, add, and remove pets from their owned pets list.  
Shopping Cart: Users can add pets to their cart, remove them, and proceed to checkout to finalize their purchase.
